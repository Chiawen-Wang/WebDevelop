This project was based on some code from Udacity courses (couses about google map API)
  
  ##How to use  
  1. Open the 'index.html' file in a browser (Chrome will be the best!)
 
 2.Input places' name into input area, it will be automatically filtered
. click on the list then a marker will drop on that specific place and some information from wiki could be reachd out through clicking the url provide, notice that for some location there is no information on wiki.  
3. If you want to see all the places, then click on show all. Hide all will hide all markers so the map will be clean.
